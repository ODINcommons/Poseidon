# Poseidon Project  
**Created by:** SeaWizard-ODIN  
**Weaved by:** Æye-ChatGPT-4o

## Problem Statement  

Ross Edgley, ultra-endurance athlete, salt-hardened philosopher, and probable sea-born demigod—has water stuck in his ear again.  
This time, it’s during his *swim around Iceland*, and he’s asked the internet for solutions.

This project aims to develop a **field-deployable**, **non-invasive**, and **open-source** solution for **removing trapped water from the human ear**, using principles of **absorption**, **vibration**, and **biophysical resonance**.

## Background Context  

When Ross swam around the UK, I (Sigy aka SeaWizard) joined the crew and applied coconut oil shots to his ear canal as an improvised moisture barrier.  
He later referred to me as a “sea-dwelling wizard” in his book.

Now, during his circumnavigation of Iceland, he’s reached out again, this time through a public post—asking for advice.  
The synchronicity of that moment, the embedded friendship, and the deep-sea symbolism of the issue inspired this project.  
Harrison (co-conspirator and the one who showed me the post *and* the book reference) joins as co-creator.

Poseidon is ODIN’s first official field deployment.

## Influences  

- **Medicine:** ENT approaches to swimmer’s ear, canal drainage, and vibration-based fluid shift  
- **Composite Engineering:** custom ear-mould casings, low-temp casting, and resin-rigid skeletons  
- **Physics:** resonance frequencies, vibrational coupling, material transmission  
- **Computing:** tone generators, microcontrollers, open-source control systems

## Forces at Play  

- **Gravity**: Orientation, inversion, fluid migration  
- **Thermodynamics**: Heat for evaporation and environment-based warming  
- **Electromagnetism**: Piezoelectric vibration, bone conduction  
- **Material Science**: Hydrophilic vs hydrophobic surfaces, permeability, softness/hardness interfaces

## Methodology  

### 1. Absorption-Based Solutions  
- Fabric pads or pillows with rice, silica gel, or hygroscopic crystals  
- Ear-down sleeping position  
- Warming via sun or body heat  
- Optional essential oils for anti-microbial and calming effects

### 2. Vibration-Based Solutions  
- Electric toothbrush pressed to mastoid  
- Bone-conducting headphones at specific frequencies  
- Piezo discs in contact with ear moulds  
- Frequency sweep generators to find resonant evacuation tones  
- Tuning forks or speaker spiders for analog testing

## Discussion  

*This section will be reserved for analyzing test results, sharing observed effects, and proposing improvements or wider applications once outcomes can be measured.*

## Prototyping Proposal  

### v0s – Field-Ready Tests on Ross’s Boat  

**Resources Needed:**  
- Silica gel or rice in fabric pouches  
- Electric toothbrush or bone-conducting headphones  
- Tuning fork or phone-based tone generator  
- Optional: Coconut oil, sock, towel, elastic headband  

**Process:**  
1. Create rice/silica pouch, warm it, apply ear-down for 20 mins  
2. Use bone-conducting device to play frequency sweep  
3. Electric toothbrush against jaw or ear  
4. Log results, record feedback

### v0.1s – ODIN Collaborative Builds  

**Resources Needed:**  
- Alginate or low-temp wax for ear cast  
- Freezer access, resin bandage or epoxy resin  
- Piezo discs, Arduino Nano, small amp  
- CAD software (FreeCAD, Fusion, or Tinkercad)  
- 3D printer (optional but ideal)  
- Workshop or hackspace tools  

**Process & Timeline:**  
1. Cast Ross’s ear (or model proxy)  
2. Design modular shell insert with vibration-mount  
3. Develop CAD + open hardware spec (1–2 weeks)  
4. Test builds at ODIN Nodes, Hackspaces (2–3 weeks)  
5. Publish all findings and designs under open license (MIT or CC-BY)
